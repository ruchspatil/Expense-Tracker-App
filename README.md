<h1 id="custom-id" align="center">EXPENSE TRACKER APP</h1>

This is an ***Expense Tracker Web App*** that tracks the way you spend your income. We will add and remove items to/from local storage. It's simple and easy to use. The application contains the CRUD Operations or (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). The system stores the categories of expenses along with the amount to spend. Every time you create or add a new expense record, the balance will automatically calculate to show you your balance for each category. All expense records added will be listed and can be deleted on the expense report page.
